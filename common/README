Parasite requirements:
- cannot link to libc
- can only use text section
  - no vtable (no .data.rel.ro)
  - no global variable 
    - no global constructor/destructor
  - no .bss (errono/environ) solved by linking with startup asm
  - no const literal (no .rodata) solved by string macro

  run with
  objdump bazel-bin/infector/infector -h
  see if .data section is generated
